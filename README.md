#Infinite Dimensions Mod

## How to help with this project
I reccomend to compare decompiled versions of 20w13b and 20w14inf. You can download a tool to decompile 20w14inf [here](https://github.com/meponderR/Minecraft-Decompiler/tree/20w14inf) and 20w13b [here](https://github.com/meponderR/Minecraft-Decompiler/tree/20w13b). You can compare the two versions with [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/?lang=en).
