# Infinite Dimensions Mod

## About 
This project is trying to up-port 20w14âˆž to newer versions such as 20w14a.

## How to add to this project
I recommend to compare decompiled versions of 20w13b and 20w14inf. You can download a tool to decompile 20w14inf [here](https://github.com/meponderR/Minecraft-Decompiler/tree/20w14inf) and 20w13b [here](https://github.com/meponderR/Minecraft-Decompiler/tree/20w13b). You can compare the two versions with [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/?lang=en). 
## Setup

```
## Build
